# Mengenlehreuhr
The Mengenlehreuhr (literally "Set Theory Clock") is a unique public clock in Berlin, Germany.

It was designed by Dieter Binninger and installed in 1975. The clock uses a system of illuminated 
colored blocks to display the time in a way inspired by set theory.
How It Works:

- The time is displayed using rows of red and yellow lights.
- The top row represents 5-hour increments.
- The second row represents single hours.
- The third row represents 5-minute increments.
- The bottom row represents single minutes.
- A small blinking light at the top marks the passing seconds.

Itâ€™s considered the first public clock to tell time using a digital, non-numeric method. 
It's a bit tricky to read at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty cool!
